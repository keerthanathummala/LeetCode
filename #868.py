'''Given a positive integer n, find and return the longest distance between any two adjacent 1's in the binary representation of n. If there are no two adjacent 1's, return 0.

Two 1's are adjacent if there are only 0's separating them (possibly no 0's). The distance between two 1's is the absolute difference between their bit positions. For example, the two 1's in "1001" have a distance of 3.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 22
Output: 2
Explanation: 22 in binary is "10110".
The first adjacent pair of 1's is "10110" with a distance of 2.
The second adjacent pair of 1's is "10110" with a distance of 1.
The answer is the largest of these two distances, which is 2.
Note that "10110" is not a valid pair since there is a 1 separating the two 1's underlined.'''
class Solution:
    def binaryGap(self, n: int) -> int:
        # Initialize the maximum distance
        max_distance = 0
      
        # Track the position of the previous 1 bit (initialize to infinity)
        previous_one_position = float('inf')
      
        # Track the current bit position (0-indexed from right)
        current_position = 0
      
        # Process each bit of n from right to left
        while n > 0:
            # Check if the current bit is 1
            if n & 1:
                # Calculate distance from previous 1 and update maximum
                max_distance = max(max_distance, current_position - previous_one_position)
                # Update the position of the most recent 1
                previous_one_position = current_position
          
            # Move to the next bit position
            current_position += 1
            # Right shift n by 1 to process the next bit
            n >>= 1
      
        return max_distance
